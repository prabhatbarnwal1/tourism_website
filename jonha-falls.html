        <b> Jonha Fall :- </b>
        The Jonha Falls (also called Gautamdhara Falls) is a waterfall located
        in Ranchi district in the Indian state of Jharkhand. The best way to
        reach water fall without using 722 steps of stairs through Jonha Fall
        Resort Road. You can see beautiful and natural scenes surrounded by
        Forest, Mountain and Rivers.
      </p>
      <p id="para2">
        This waterfall is close to the city Ranchi, so if you want to come from
        other states, it will be good to come first to Ranchi. From there you
        will have to move NH-33 on the route going to Jamshedpur by bus. Then a
        private vehicle will be accessible to NH-33 only because public
        transport is not available there. Jonha Falls is about 400 km from
        Kolkata. National Highway No. 33 or 30 km from Ranchi on NH-33 is a
        village, 100 km north from Jamshedpur and a village - Tamara. Then 10 km

        west of Taimara is towards the west - Jonha Falls Bundu is the closest
        subdivision, 25 km away from here. Earlier this area was in Ranchi
        district but in the meantime the peg has arrived in the district. Some
        rural settlements get in the way from the main road, then the road
        passing through the thick forest leads directly to the tenth floor. If
        you leave from Jamshedpur, 38 km east of this region is a famous Diwari
        temple at the place called Tamad.
