        <b> Sita Fall :- </b>
        Though it is one of the lesser known waterfalls, your trip of the
        waterfalls in Ranchi is incomplete without a visit here. Being close to
        Jonha, it is not difficult to reach here. The rocky gradient down where
        the water trickles, seems to have been sculpted by none other than
        Nature itself. The view caresses away both your physical and mental
        strains, leaving you recharged as the fresh and foaming water of the
        falls. The site is well connected with both rail and bus routes. Nestled
        in a tranquil setting surrounded by dense forests, Sita Falls offers a
        picturesque and calming retreat. The waterfall descends from a height of
        around 144 feet and forms a natural pool below, presenting a
        breathtaking view. With rocks and boulders encircling the pool, it’s an
        ideal location to unwind and relish the natural beauty of the
        surroundings.

        If you are capable and energized to hike more, do not miss the
        opportunity to trek over the boulders and reach the base of the
        waterfall. It’s a very short hiking path but offers unforgettable
        experiences. The trail involves traversing over uneven boulders and
        crossing multiple narrow streams that are initiated from the falls. The
        hike may be slightly strenuous for the elderly and children, but the
        spectacular frontal view of the waterfall at the end of the trek makes
        it an incredibly rewarding experience. Upon reaching Sita Falls, you’ll
        discover a peaceful ambiance, unlike the bustling crowds that frequent
        other popular Ranchi attractions such as Dassam Waterfalls, Hundru
        Falls, or Patratu. The lack of awareness about Sita Falls amongst
        tourists is one of the reasons for its relatively unoccupied nature.
