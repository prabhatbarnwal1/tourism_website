        <b> Dassam Fall :- </b>
        Dasam Falls is famed for its beauty and as a valuable source of
        hydroelectric power. Balancing recreational and commercial uses has been
        a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 1930s. This Dasam
        waterfall is formed when the river Abe of Swarnekhara falls from a
        height of 144 ft (44 m) flowing from the plateau of southern
        Chhotanagpur plateau or Ranchi. If you want to see Leela of the
        mountains of Jharkhand, this place is the best, which at first glance
        really looks like the Himalayan valleys. Forests are forests all around
        and the waterfall of the spring is quite deep. At rainy time, it takes a
        very frightening look.

      <p id="para2">
        This waterfall is close to the city Ranchi, so if you want to come from
        other states, it will be good to come first to Ranchi. From there you
        will have to move NH-33 on the route going to Jamshedpur by bus. Then a
        private vehicle will be accessible to NH-33 only because public
        transport is not available there. Dasam Falls is about 400 km from
        Kolkata. National Highway No. 33 or 30 km from Ranchi on NH-33 is a
        village, 100 km north from Jamshedpur and a village - Tamara. Then 10 km
        west of Taimara is towards the west - Dasam Falls Bundu is the closest
        subdivision, 25 km away from here. Earlier this area was in Ranchi
        district but in the meantime the peg has arrived in the district. Some
        rural settlements get in the way from the main road, then the road
        passing through the thick forest leads directly to the tenth floor. If
        you leave from Jamshedpur, 38 km east of this region is a famous Diwari
        temple at the place called Tamad.
